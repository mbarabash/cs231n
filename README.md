# cs231n

This is a repository containing the homework for the Stanford graduate course cs231n. I audited this course over the course of Summer 2018.

My code can be found by looking for "TODO" comments. (The initial drafts of the files were supplied with the homework assignment)

The directly executed code can be found in files \*.ipnb, however most of the code that I wrote is contained in subdirectories in assignment\*/cs231n/classifiers and assignment\*/cs231n
